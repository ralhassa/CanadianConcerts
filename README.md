# CanadianConcerts

MSCI346:Database Systems Course Project

This is a relational database application with a user interface that allows users to browse a set of canadian concerts and through different filters.

This project was completed following agile development methodoligies in a group of myself and 2 of my peers. My main contribution was creating and managing all the functions of the user interface and database communications.
